                        <p class="about__bio-text">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band
                            originating from San Francisco, California.
                            The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan
                            Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist
                            Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and
                            drummer Freddie Fischer. The band
                            achieved its first commercial success as an
                            unsigned act, drawing attention from
                            manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
                            other popular acts (The Elephant In The
                            Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow),
                            Adams was confident the band could
                            succeed even further, pushing them to sign
                            with Magenta Records.</p>

                    <div class="about__bio-text-wrapper">
                        <p class="about__bio-text">From there, the band has soared, gaining
                            international recognition and ranking in the
                            top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                            immediately fell in love with the band’s
                            original and organic attitude, solidifying
                            their place as one of the hottest and fastest
                            up and coming acts of this century. Fans
                            affectionately refer to themselves as “The
                            Hive” and are drawn to their candid and
                            authentic performances on stage. Looking
                            forward to touring in the future, The Bees
                            Knees are currently recording their second
                            studio album, looking to be released in late
                            2021.</p>
